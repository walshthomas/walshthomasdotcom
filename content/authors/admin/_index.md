Hi! Welcome to my website.

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Economics at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/business/aboutus/" target="_blank"> Adam Smith Business School, University of Glasgow</a>.

I am an applied macroeconomist with interests in firm dynamics, labour markets, and monetary and fiscal policy.

I received my PhD in Economics from the <a href="https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics" target="_blank">European University Institute</a>
 in May 2023.

I am on the 2025-26 Academic Job Market! The current draft of my job market paper: "Earnings Management and Investment"
